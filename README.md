Here we have taken 10 years of data from companies like NVIDIA, KLAC, TSM, AVGO, AMD and QUALCOMM from yahoo finance. 
After simply plotting the data we can see that the KLAC is leading the charts and we can see the uptrend there. But the actual stock price is not the indication of the companies 
perfomance so therefore we normalise all the close price and start them with 100.

After the noramalisation as you can see the closing price is starting from 100 in the image below:-

As we can see after normalisation of data we can finally see that NVIDIA is leading chip maker among all the other chip makers since the decade.
